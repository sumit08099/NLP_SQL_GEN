**NLP2SQL** is a professional-grade autonomous data intelligence platform that transforms Natural Language into precise PostgreSQL queries. Engineered for scale and precision, it utilizes a sophisticated **Multi-Agent Orchestration** model to navigate complex schemas, identify analytical trends, and self-heal from errors.

## 🚀 The Multi-Agent Intelligence Layer

Unlike simple NL2SQL scripts, this platform utilizes **LangGraph** to coordinate a team of specialized AI agents:

### 1. 🎯 Supervisor (Semantic Filter)
Acts as the project manager. It performs a **Semantic Schema Search** to identify the most relevant tables from your knowledge base, stripping away noise to keep the reasoning engine focused.

### 2. 🧠 Reasoning Architect (Two-Step Strategy)
Engineered for logic. It follows a **Two-Step Strategy**:
*   **Logic Path**: First, it plans the joints, filters, and aggregations in plain English.
*   **SQL Generation**: Only after the logic is sound does it generate the final PostgreSQL.

### 3. 🔍 Reflection Agent (Schema-Obsessed Auditor)
The code reviewer. It performs a strict **Hallucination Check**, verifying every column and table name against the actual DB schema before allowing execution.

### 4. ⚡ Executor (Self-Healing Loop)
Runs the code. If the database reports an error, the Executor captures the traceback and feeds it back into the Reasoning loop for an **Error-Aware Retry**.

### 5. 📝 Pro Formatter (Analytical Storytelling)
The data analyst. It doesn't just list rows—it performs **Analytical Storytelling**, identifying patterns, trends, and anomalies to answer the "Why" behind the data.

## 🌟 Advanced Features

*   **Hybrid Intelligence**: Seamlessly blends a local fine-tuned ML model with Gemini 2.0 Flash for maximum speed and accuracy.
*   **Semantic Knowledge Mapping**: Simply upload a CSV or Excel file, and the AI maps the entire schema into its neural memory instantly.
*   **Security Protocol**: Enterprise-grade JWT authentication and bcrypt password encryption ensure your data remains isolated and secure.
*   **Premium Workspace**: A state-of-the-art glassmorphic UI featuring real-time AI thought visualization, technical detail expansion, and automated system clock synchronization.
